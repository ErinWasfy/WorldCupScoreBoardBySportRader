# WorldCupScoreBoardBySportRader
This task implementation includes some business functionalities to handle the scoreboard games and before explaining each of these functionalities, let's assume that we have a scoreboard for 
two teams and these teams need to be initiated by constructor of the class and set the initial score of both teams to zero.
After then, start implementing the functionalities of the scoreboard that include updating ,completion of the match and finally summary of the pair matches sorted by the total score. Let me
explain these functions in detail as follows:
-Update process with method name(matchUpdated): Able to update the score of the current match by simply getting the current pair match .
-Complete process with method name(matchFinished): Able to remove the match from the scoreboard game.
-Summary process with method name(summarizedMatch): Fetch the matches order by the largest total score of both of teams.
Finally, I set up test cases for each functionalities inside the project.
